## Installation

To install ZoneTree.FullTextSearch, you can add the package to your project via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package ZoneTree.FullTextSearch
```

## Usage

### Setting Up a Search Engine

To create an instance of `HashedSearchEngine`, initialize it with the required parameters:

```csharp
using ZoneTree.FullTextSearch.SearchEngines;

// Initialize the search engine
using var searchEngine = new HashedSearchEngine<int>(
    dataPath: "data",
    useSecondaryIndex: true,
    wordTokenizer: new WordTokenizer(),
    refComparer: null
);
```

### Adding Records

To add a record to the search engine, use the `AddRecord` method:

```csharp
searchEngine.AddRecord(1, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.");
```

### Searching Records

To perform a search, use the `Search` method:

```csharp
var results = searchEngine.Search("quick fox", respectTokenOrder: true);
```

### Deleting Records

To delete a record from the search engine:

```csharp
searchEngine.DeleteRecord(1);
```

### Pagination

In addition to basic searching, you can easily implement pagination using the `skip` and `limit` parameters in the `Search` method. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets where you only want to display a subset of the results at a time.

```csharp
var resultsPage1 = searchEngine.Search(
    search: "quick fox",
    respectTokenOrder: true,
    skip: 0, // Skip 0 records, start from the beginning
    limit: 10 // Limit to 10 records in this page
);

var resultsPage2 = searchEngine.Search(
    search: "quick fox",
    respectTokenOrder: true,
    skip: 10, // Skip the first 10 records
    limit: 10 // Limit to 10 records in this page
);
```

### Adding Facets

To associate a facet (e.g., category, author) with a record:

```csharp
searchEngine.AddFacet(1, "category", "books");
searchEngine.AddFacet(1, "author", "John Doe");
```

### Deleting Facets

To remove a specific facet associated with a record:

```csharp
searchEngine.DeleteFacet(1, "category", "books");
searchEngine.DeleteFacet(1, "author", "John Doe");
```

### Faceted Search

If you're also filtering by facets, you can still apply pagination by specifying the `skip` and `limit` parameters:

```csharp
var facets = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    { "category", "books" },
    { "author", "John Doe" }
};

var paginatedFacetedResultsPage1 = searchEngine.Search(
    search: "quick fox",
    facets: facets,
    respectTokenOrder: true,
    skip: 0, // Start from the first matching record
    limit: 10 // Retrieve up to 10 records
);

var paginatedFacetedResultsPage2 = searchEngine.Search(
    search: "quick fox",
    facets: facets,
    respectTokenOrder: true,
    skip: 10, // Skip the first 10 matching records
    limit: 10 // Retrieve the next 10 records
);
```

### Cleanup

When you're done using the search engine, ensure proper cleanup:

```csharp
searchEngine.Dispose();
```

## Customization

### Custom Tokenizer

You can implement your own tokenizer by adhering to the `IWordTokenizer` interface:

```csharp
public sealed class CustomTokenizer : IWordTokenizer
{
    public IReadOnlyList<Slice> GetSlices(ReadOnlySpan<char> text)
    {
        // Custom tokenization logic
    }

    public IEnumerable<Slice> EnumerateSlices(ReadOnlyMemory<char> text)
    {
        // Custom tokenization logic
    }
}
```

Then, pass the custom tokenizer to the `HashedSearchEngine`:

```csharp
var searchEngine = new HashedSearchEngine<int>(
    wordTokenizer: new CustomTokenizer()
);
```

### Stemming using a Custom Hash Generator

1. **Stemming Integration**: In the custom hash generator, you can integrate a stemming library to reduce each word to its stem before hashing.
2. **Stemming Libraries**: You can use any existing .NET stemming library, such as **PorterStemmer** or **SnowballStemmer**, within your custom hash generator to perform the stemming process.

### Example Custom Hash Generator with Stemming

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example of how you could implement a custom hash generator that incorporates stemming:

```csharp
public sealed class StemmingHashCodeGenerator : IHashCodeGenerator
{
    private readonly IStemmer Stemmer;

    public StemmingHashCodeGenerator(IStemmer stemmer)
    {
        Stemmer = stemmer;
    }

    public ulong GetHashCode(ReadOnlySpan<char> text)
    {
        return GetHashCode(text.ToString());
    }

    public ulong GetHashCode(string text)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text)) return 0;
        var stemmedWord = Stemmer.Stem(text); // Apply stemming
        return ComputeHash(stemmedWord.AsSpan());
    }

    public ulong GetHashCode(ReadOnlyMemory<char> text)
    {
        return GetHashCode(text.Span);
    }

    ulong ComputeHash(ReadOnlySpan<char> text)
    {
        if (text.IsWhiteSpace()) return 0;
        var hashedValue = 3074457345618258791ul;
        for (var i = 0; i < text.Length; i++)
        {
            hashedValue += char.ToLowerInvariant(text[i]);
            hashedValue *= 3074457345618258799ul;
        }
        return hashedValue;
    }
}
```

### Using a Stemming Library

You can use a stemming library in the custom hash generator like this:

```csharp
// Example of using a stemming library (like PorterStemmer)
var stemmer = new PorterStemmer(); // Assuming this is a class from the stemming library
var hashCodeGenerator = new StemmingHashCodeGenerator(stemmer);

var searchEngine = new HashedSearchEngine<int>(
    hashCodeGenerator: hashCodeGenerator
);
```

### Benefits

- **Improved Search Accuracy**: By stemming words, the search engine can match related terms more effectively, ensuring that different forms of a word (e.g., "run," "running," "ran") are all indexed under the same root form.
- **Flexibility**: You can swap out the stemming algorithm easily by using a different stemming library or custom implementation, depending on the specific language or domain requirements.

## Using RecordTable for Dual-Key Storage

The `RecordTable` class in ZoneTree.FullTextSearch provides a powerful dual-key storage solution where both keys can act as a lookup for the other. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and query data based on two different keys.

### Key Features

- **Two Synchronized ZoneTrees:** `RecordTable` manages two synchronized ZoneTrees, enabling fast lookups by either the primary key (record) or the secondary key (value).
- **Background Maintenance:** Automatic background maintenance tasks to manage caches and optimize performance.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplified API for inserting, querying, and managing records with dual keys.

### Why RecordTable is Needed

The `RecordTable` is essential when you need to handle complex records that the search engine index cannot directly manage due to its reliance on unmanaged types (simple, fixed-size data types). Since the search engine is optimized for these types, it cannot store more complex data like strings or classes directly.

If your application doesn't use a separate database for managing and looking up records, `RecordTable` acts as an embedded solution, allowing you to map and store complex records efficiently. It synchronizes with the search engine, providing dual-key lookups without needing an external database, simplifying your application's architecture while maintaining high performance.

### Basic Usage

#### Initializing RecordTable

To set up a `RecordTable`, simply provide the necessary types and an optional data path for storage:

```csharp
using ZoneTree.FullTextSearch;

var recordTable = new RecordTable<int, string>(dataPath: "data/recordTable");
```

#### Inserting Records

You can insert or update records using the `UpsertRecord` method, which ensures that both keys (record and value) are synchronized across the two ZoneTrees:

```csharp
recordTable.UpsertRecord(1, "Value1");
recordTable.UpsertRecord(2, "Value2");
```

#### Retrieving Data by Primary Key

To retrieve a value associated with a given record (primary key), use the `TryGetValue` method:

```csharp
if (recordTable.TryGetValue(1, out var value))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Record 1 has value: {value}");
}
```

#### Retrieving Data by Secondary Key

Conversely, you can retrieve a record using its associated value (secondary key) with the `TryGetRecord` method:

```csharp
if (recordTable.TryGetRecord("Value2", out var record))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Value2 is associated with record: {record}");
}
```

#### Dropping the RecordTable

When you no longer need the `RecordTable`, you can drop it to clean up all resources and delete the data:

```csharp
recordTable.Drop();
```

#### Disposing the RecordTable

Ensure to dispose of the `RecordTable` properly to close any open resources:

```csharp
recordTable.Dispose();
```

### Example Scenario

Imagine a scenario where you're storing user profiles where the `TRecord` is a unique user ID and the `TValue` is the user's email. With `RecordTable`, you can quickly find the user ID by email or retrieve the user's email by their ID, all while ensuring data consistency between the two ZoneTrees.

```csharp
var userTable = new RecordTable<int, string>("data/users");

// Adding users
userTable.UpsertRecord(101, "user101@example.com");
userTable.UpsertRecord(102, "user102@example.com");

// Lookup by ID
if (userTable.TryGetValue(101, out var email))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"User 101's email: {email}");
}

// Lookup by email
if (userTable.TryGetRecord("user102@example.com", out var userId))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Email user102@example.com belongs to user ID: {userId}");
}
```

This dual-key approach greatly simplifies scenarios where data needs to be accessed and managed from multiple perspectives.
